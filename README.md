# ML_preprocessing
Preprocessing required to build ML model:
           Data preprocessing is required for every machine learning model.
     Everything in the code is simple and easy to understand.
     i.e., Importing libraries, importing data
     Data has to be checked for null values and taken care of as
     they tend to reduce accuracy and also disrupt clean training of
     the model.
           The categorical features must encoded if they are not
     readily encode in the data.
           The final section that is Feature Scaling is used when 
     some feature of the data(independent) have a longer range, which 
     makes gradient descent slower and may affect model accuracy.
     Usually Standardisation is used because it works in all situations.
     Usually after standardisation feature ranges between -3 and +3 making
     the gradiennt descent faster.
